# Welcome to Dynamic Programming and Structural Econometrics

This repository contains teaching materials for lectures in the master level course in **Dynamic Programming and Structural Econometrics** that I teach at the Economics program at University of Copenhagen. 

Videotaped lectures from parts of the course given in 2021 are available at the [Lectures in Dynamic Programming playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbVIgzWt8So&list=PLzkJu0O0lYnEpJNYJ4Ent_qckS0OKkYYg) on Bertel Schjernings [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/BSchjerning)

Repository will be updated as we go a along
